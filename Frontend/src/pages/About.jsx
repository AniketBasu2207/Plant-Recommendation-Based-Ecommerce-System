              Florus is a modern approach to gardening that uses technology to
              make planting easier and more effective. It helps gardeners by
              giving advice based on important factors like weather, soil type,
              fertilisers and Plant Hardiness Zones (which show how well plants
              grow in different climates). With Smart Gardening, users can check
              if a plant will grow in their area based on their location,
              environmental conditions and weather. The system can also suggest
              the best plants for them to grow.
