# 🌿 Florus – A Plant Recommendation Based E-commerce System

**Florus** is an intelligent and interactive e-commerce system focused on recommending the most suitable plants to users based on their local environment. It combines the power of machine learning with a full-featured e-commerce experience to help users discover and purchase plants that thrive in their region.

#### 🧠 How It Works:

Florus uses a **Machine Learning model** powered by **Cosine Similarity** to recommend plants.
The system analyzes user-provided inputs such as:

* Zip code
* Environmental conditions
* Climate factors

It then compares these inputs against a curated dataset of plants using cosine similarity to suggest the most compatible options for the user.
